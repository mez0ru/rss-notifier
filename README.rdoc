= RSS Notifier

This is a personal application in which I use to keep track of vtubers' unarchived streams,
It checks in interval, and when it detects a new stream, it runs a command if it matches the keywords I specified.

  git clone https://github.com/mez0ru/rss-notifier.git rss-notifier
  cd rss-notifier
  rake "setup[MyApp]"
